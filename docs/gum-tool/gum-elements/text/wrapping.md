# Wrapping

## Introduction

Text instances can wrap their text or can extend horizontally to fill their text. A number of properties control wrapping. For more information, see the following properties:

* [Width Units](../general-properties/width-units.md) - Controls whether the text extends to fit its text or whether text wraps within the bounds. To make text extend horizontally (not wrap) set its Width Units to [Relative To Children](../general-properties/width-units.md#relative-to-children). Otherwise, text wraps within its bounds.
* [Text Overflow Horizontal Mode](text-overflow-horizontal-mode.md) - Controls whether overflowing words are truncated or have an appended ellipsis.&#x20;
