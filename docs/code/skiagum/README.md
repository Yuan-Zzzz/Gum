# SkiaGum

SkiaGum allows you to render Gum in any SkiaSharp canvas. This extends the ability to use Gum on any Skia platform including WPF, .NET Maui, Avalonia, and server backend.&#x20;

SkiaGum can be used code-only, or it can be used in combination with the Gum UI tool. If using the Gum UI tool, you need to add Skia standard elements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not all platforms support SkiaGum. For more information, see the [SkiaGum Platform Support](skiagum-platform-support.md) page.
{% endhint %}

For example, as of April 2024, Skia objects cannot be used in MonoGame projects unless the project is a FlatRedBall project.
